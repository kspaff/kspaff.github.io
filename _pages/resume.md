## Experience

**Cofounder and Head of Software - [Macula Vision Systems](http://macula-vision.com)**

<font size="3">October 2021 - Present</font>

 * Leading software development for an exciting application in the realm of digital holographic microscopy


---------

**Principal Software Engineer - [Accelerate Diagnostics](https://acceleratediagnostics.com/)**

<font size="3">January 2014 - September 2021</font>


 * Developed Clonetracker, the image processing component of the Pheno product. Clonetracker implements 
a traditional image processing pipeline to analyze bacteria in fluorescence and dark-field microscopy images in C++/CUDA.
Working in a team of three, I was solely responsible for application performance and the production 
codebase from inception to 2018. It is in use in hundreds of hospitals.
 * Designed, procured, and implemented the Opus Feasibility Computing Environment, an on-premises
 all-flash parallel filesystem, private high-speed ethernet network, and GPU-based batch processing system
 to support algorithm development for AXDX's next AST instrument.
 * Developed a software package for manual and automated interpretation of broth microdilution (BMD) plates. 
This software provided key reference data for the Pheno product. Automated interpretation based on optical density 
matched expert human performance.
 * Lead statistician on the Pheno FDA De Novo clinical trial and submission. I designed the set of experiments, analyzed all
data in R, provided results for the clinical study report, and negotiated labeling with FDA. I also led clinical trial design 
for the Pheno Bacterial Pneumonia (BP) test kit in which I successfully negotiated a 75% reduction in prospective samples required in the main arm of the study.

**Senior Software Engineer - [ArrayFire](https://arrayfire.com/)**

<font size="3">May 2013 - December 2013</font>

* Developed optimized CUDA kernels for clients' production codebases (including MathWorks's
Matlab) and the ArrayFire open source library


---------

**Computer Scientist (Future Technologies Group) - [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://ornl.gov)**

<font size="3">June 2009 - May 2013</font>

Performed independent computer science research evaluating emerging computing technologies
and supported DoE's scientific applications. Select projects include:

 * **Aspen:** A domain specific language for performance modeling designed to estimate the 
 tradeoffs of large-scale scientific applications
 * **SHOC:** A benchmark suite for GPU clusters including low-level performance primitives through
 kernels of scientific applications, implemented in CUDA, OpenCL, and MPI.
 * **Keeneland:** NSF's 5-year, Track 2D project to bring innovative computing architectures to
 the open science community. I was involved in all aspects of the system including acquisition, 
 benchmarking, acceptance testing, and application tuning for the 264-node cluster. 
 * **S3D**: I developed a GPU-accelerated version of S3D, software for direct numerical simulation
 of turbulent combustion (Navier-Stokes) with complex chemistry, implemented in CUDA and MPI.
