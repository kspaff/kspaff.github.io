![Me](/images/headshot.png)

Hi there.

I'm Kyle, a software engineer and entrepreneur based in Austin, Texas. 
I've been developing production computer vision software for medical devices since 2014
with a focus on the [Pheno](/project/pheno) and Opus platforms. 
Prior to medical devices, I worked on parallelization and GPU-acceleration of large-scale
scientific codebases at [ORNL](http://ornl.gov) in the Future Technologies Group.
I'm broadly interested in scientific programmming and tend to work in C, CUDA, and/or Python
depending on the application.
